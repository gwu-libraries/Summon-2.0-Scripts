# Summon 2.0 Customizations

This project is forked from GVSU's excellent work (https://github.com/gvsulib/Summon-2.0-Scripts)

These files are the JavaScript, CSS, and PHP scripts that modify the stock Summon 2.0 discovery interface for our patrons. The JavaScript (summon2.js) is loaded by the tool, and it adds the custom CSS file (summon2.css) to the document &lt;head&gt;.
